# Introducing Cubical-Script
  Cubical-Script is a tool designed to simulate the behaviour seen withing ["perfect-tower"](https://github.com/d0sboots/PerfectTower?tab=readme-ov-file#improved-code-editor), a parser made by David Walker (nicknamed d0sboots) for the game ["The Perfect Tower II"](https://www.perfecttower2.com/), on your local computer.
  This program is structured to support syntax highlighting, token suggestions, implemented code snippets and, most importantly, cross compatibility between the game and David Walker's editor.
  In its current state, Cubical-Script is a prototype with the ability to read the source code exported from "perfect-tower" and expand it into a formatted text that's easier to read.
