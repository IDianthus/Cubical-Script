# Introducing Cubical-Script

Cubical-Script is a tool designed to imitate the behaviour seen from "perfect-tower", a parser made by David Walker (nicknamed d0sboots) that improves the mechanics of the game "The Perfect Tower II". This program is structured to support syntax highlighting, token suggestions, implemented code snippets and, most importantly, cross compatibility between the game and David Walker's editor.
In its current state, Cubical-Script is a prototype with the ability to read the source code exported from "perfect-tower" and expand it into a formatted text that's easier to edit.
